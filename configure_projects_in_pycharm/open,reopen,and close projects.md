1. Opening a project
    - Open your project from disk
        1. Do one of the following:
            - On the `Welcome Screen`, click the `Open` link.
            - From the main menu, select `File |Open`.
        2. In the `Open File or Project` dialog that opens, find location of the desired project directory. `The PyCharm project` are marked with `JB IDE project` and projects created in other IDEs or in a dedicated editor are marked with `a directory icon`.
        3. Click `OK`.

    - Open a project from Git
        1. Do one of the following:
            - On the `Welcome Screen`, click the `Get from Version Control` link.
            - From the main menu, select `VCS | Get from Version Control`.
        2. Select the `version control` system where your project is stored. Here it is `Git`.
        3. Specify the `path` to the repository and select the `directory` to which a project will be cloned. Alternatively, you can select `GitHub` on the left, login using your credentials, and select any project you want to work with.
        4. Click `Clone`.
    - Open multiple projects
        1. Open a project, while another one is already opened.
        2. If the `New Window` option is selected, the new project silently opens in a new window. The `Attach` option appears in the File menu.
        3. If the `This Window` option is selected, the new project silently opens in the same window, replacing the currently opened project. The `Attach` Project command appears in the File menu.
        4. If the `Attach` option is selected, PyCharm attaches the new project to the currently opened project. The project that has already been opened is the `primary project`.
      
    - Delete a project from view
        1. In the Project tool window, `right-click` the project to be deleted.
        2. From the context menu of the selection, choose `Remove from Project View`, or press `Delete`.

2. Reopening recent projects
    - Open a recent project
        1. Call `File | Open Recent` from the main menu and select the desired project from the list.
        2. On the `Welcome screen`, click Projects on the `left-hand` pane and then select the project of interest in the right-hand pane where the list of your recent projects is shown. Start typing in the Search projects field to filter the list of recent projects.

3. Closing projects
   If you need to close only one project, you can either close the project window or select `File | Close Project` from the main menu.
   When you have only one open project and you close it, PyCharm displays the Welcome screen. In case of multiple projects, each one is closed with its frame.
   - Close all projects
      1. From the main menu, select `File | Close All Projects`.
      2. This action closes all projects that are currently opened in PyCharm.

   - Close all but the current project
      1. From the main menu, select `File | Close Other Projects`.
      2. This action closes all opened projects except the current one.
  
   - Remove a project from the list of recent projects
      1. Click `Open Recent` on the File menu, then click `Manage Projects` at the very bottom of the recent project list.
      2. Click the `closing icon` for the project to remove.
      3. The selected project will be removed from the list of the recent project in the `Project window` and on the `Welcome screen`.
      4. To remove a project only from the list on the `Welcome Screen`, right-click the target project and select `Remove Selected` from `Welcome Screen`.
4. Switching between projects
   To switch between open projects, you can use the following commands of the `Window` menu:
    - `Window | Next Project Window` Ctrl+Alt+]
    - `Window | Previous Project Window` Ctrl+Alt+[
